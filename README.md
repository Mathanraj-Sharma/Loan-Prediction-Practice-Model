# Loan-Prediction-Practice-Model
This a simple loan prediction model created using sklearn library.

01. First go through the Data analysis scripts. 
02. Then try running model_sklearn.py, it uses logistic regression algorithm. 
03. After that try running model_sklearn_StratifiedKFold.py, it uses StratifiedKFold algorithm for resambling the training data     for training and evalution
04. Compare the accuracy rates.
